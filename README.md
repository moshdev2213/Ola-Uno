OLA UNO is an IoT project designed to facilitate hands-on learning in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) 🌐. The project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller board 🤖, known for its versatility and capabilities in IoT applications. Two LEDs 💡💡 are integrated into the setup, which are controlled via an Express server 🖥️.

The architecture involves a client-server model where a React-based client interface 📱 communicates with the Express server. Through HTTP protocol 🌐, React sends commands to the Express server, which in turn interacts with the ESP32 device 🤖 to toggle the LEDs on and off 💡🔄 based on user input. This setup not only demonstrates basic IoT functionalities like remote control and data exchange but also provides a practical example of integrating hardware, server-side logic, and frontend development in IoT projects 🚀.
